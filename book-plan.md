# ADK Textbook Plan

A multi-chapter demo-driven textbook for Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) in the academic research domain, exploring evaluation-driven agent development.

## Book Overview

**Theme**: Evaluation-driven agent development in academic research
**Structure**: Progressive complexity from configuration-only to advanced Python agents
**Domain Focus**: Academic research tools and workflows

## Chapter Structure

### Chapter 1: Agents Without Code ‚úÖ
- **Status**: Complete
- **Approach**: Configuration-only agents using YAML
- **Key Concepts**: 
  - ADK fundamentals
  - Google search tool integration
  - CLI and web interfaces
  - Anti-cheating detection example
- **Files**: `textbook-adk-ch01/`

### Chapter 2: Python Agents with Custom Tools ‚úÖ  
- **Status**: Complete
- **Approach**: Python-based agents with custom tool functions
- **Key Concepts**:
  - `LlmAgent` class and programmatic configuration
  - Custom tool development patterns
  - Mock data implementation
  - Multi-database search strategies
  - Professional project structure
- **Demo**: Paper finder agent with academic database search
- **Files**: `textbook-adk-ch02/paperfinder/`

## Technical Notes

### ADK Evaluation System
‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: The `adk eval` command is currently **EXPERIMENTAL** and has significant limitations:

- **Local evaluation service**: Incomplete and requires additional configuration
- **Tool trajectory matching**: Extremely strict, often fails on minor parameter differences
- **Google Cloud dependency**: Appears designed primarily for cloud-based evaluation
- **Limited documentation**: Configuration options not well documented
- **Workaround**: Focus on `response_match_score` metrics only, avoid `tool_trajectory_avg_score`

### Evaluation Configuration
Current working pattern for test configs:
```json
{
    "criteria": {
        "response_match_score": 0.1
    }
}
```

Avoid `tool_trajectory_avg_score` due to overly strict matching requirements.

## Development Patterns

### Mock Data Strategy
- All Chapter 2 tools use mock data for immediate functionality
- Realistic data structures that mirror real APIs
- Easy transition path to production APIs
- Predictable responses for testing and evaluation

### Evaluation-Driven Development
- Each chapter includes comprehensive test suites
- Multiple evaluation scenarios per agent
- Focus on response quality over strict tool matching
- Incremental complexity in test cases
