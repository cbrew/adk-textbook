# ADK Textbook Plan

A multi-chapter demo-driven textbook for Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) in the academic research domain, exploring evaluation-driven agent development.

## Book Overview

**Theme**: Evaluation-driven agent development in academic research
**Structure**: Progressive complexity from configuration-only to production systems
**Domain Focus**: Academic research tools and workflows

## Current Status: Advanced Production Systems ‚úÖ

The textbook has evolved beyond the initial plan to include **complete production-ready implementations**:

## Technical Notes

### ADK Evaluation System
‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: The `adk eval` command is currently **EXPERIMENTAL** and has significant limitations:

- **Local evaluation service**: Incomplete and requires additional configuration
- **Tool trajectory matching**: Extremely strict, often fails on minor parameter differences
- **Google Cloud dependency**: Appears designed primarily for cloud-based evaluation
- **Limited documentation**: Configuration options not well documented
- **Workaround**: Focus on `response_match_score` metrics only, avoid `tool_trajectory_avg_score`

### Evaluation Configuration
Current working pattern for test configs:
```json
{
    "criteria": {
        "response_match_score": 0.1
    }
}
```

Avoid `tool_trajectory_avg_score` due to overly strict matching requirements.

## Learning Progression

The textbook follows a carefully designed progression from fundamental concepts to production systems:

1. **Chapters 1-2**: Foundation (Config-based agents ‚Üí Python agents with tools)

- Production monitoring and observability

### Chapter 10: Capstone Project - Academic Research Ecosystem
**Project Overview**: Integrate all concepts to build a comprehensive scientific research system using ADK, inspired by Allen AI's Asta.

- **Multi-Agent Research System**: Literature review, data analysis, citation network analysis agents
- **Production Integration**: Real MCP-based Semantic Scholar access, multi-database orchestration

**Learning Outcomes**: Students build a production-ready scientific research assistant showcasing every major ADK concept, creating a portfolio piece demonstrating mastery from basic tools to enterprise systems.

## Development Patterns

### Mock Data Strategy
- All Chapter 2 tools use mock data for immediate functionality
- Realistic data structures that mirror real APIs
- Easy transition path to production APIs
- Predictable responses for testing and evaluation

### Evaluation-Driven Development
- Each chapter includes comprehensive test suites
- Multiple evaluation scenarios per agent
- Focus on response quality over strict tool matching
- Incremental complexity in test cases
