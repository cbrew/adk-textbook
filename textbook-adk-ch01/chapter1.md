# Chapter 1. Agents Without Code

## Learning Goals
By the end of this chapter you will:
- Understand what an **agent** is in the ADK framework.
- Learn the difference between the **core agent loop** and external tools.
- Run your first agent using **only configuration files**, no Python coding yet.
- Use the **ADK developer tools** (`adk run` and `adk web`) to inspect agent behavior.

---

## 1.1 What is an Agent?

An **agent** in ADK is a software component that:
1. Accepts structured **inputs** (usually text or JSON).
2. Chooses actions (invoke a tool, call a sub-agent, generate text).
3. Produces structured **outputs**.

ADK encourages **idiomatic design**:
- Explicitly define the agent’s **purpose**.
- Make tools and inputs **declarative**.
- Always think about **evaluation** from the start.

---

## 1.2 A No-Code Agent

Start by generating an agent using the `adk create` command.

```bash
adk create --type=config first_agent
```
This creates a folder called first_agent
```aiexclude
first_agent
├── .env
├── __init__.py
└── root_agent.yaml
```
All the action is in `root_agent.yaml` which looks as follows:

```
name: root_agent
description: A helpful assistant for user questions.
instruction: Answer user questions to the best of your knowledge
model: gemini-2.5-flash
```
That's all there is to it. The filename `root_agent.yaml` is required. 
The four lines are enough to completely satisfy the requirements for
an ADK agent, and they were all generated by a`adk create`.

During the creation process you were prompted to choose a way of authenticating
for a Google model. This requires you to sign up for an account and get an API 
key. 


## 1.3 Running the Agent

Bring up a shell in the same directory as this chapter, ensure that you are using a
suitable virtual environment, and do the following:


### With `adk run`

```bash
adk run first_agent 
```

If you want, you can use `uv` in which case the command is:

```bash
uv run adk run first_agent 
```

Example prompt:

```
> What can you do?
```

Answer will be something like:

```aiexclude
[root_agent]: I am a helpful AI assistant. I can do many things, including:

*   **Answer questions:** I can provide information on a wide range of topics.
*   **Provide explanations:** If you need something clarified, I'll do my best to explain it.
*   **Summarize information:** I can distill long texts into key points.
*   **Generate creative content:** I can help write stories, poems, code, scripts, musical pieces, email, letters, etc.
*   **Assist with writing:** I can help you brainstorm ideas, refine your text, or check grammar and spelling.
*   **Offer suggestions:** I can give recommendations based on your needs.
*   **Translate languages:** I can translate text between various languages.
*   **And much more!** Just ask me anything you have in mind, and I'll do my best to assist you.

The response varies a bit from run to run: LLMs are like that. But the substance will be 
the same.

### With `adk web`

You can bring up a rich ui by simply typing:

```bash
adk web 
```
You will see something like:
```aiexclude
INFO:     Started server process [18424]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.

Open a browser on the given link, and you will be chatting. Because `first_agent` is the only 
sub-folder with a valid agent inside it, it will open automatically to a chat window that 
interacts with the agent. Later, when there are several agents, there will be an initial step
where you have to choose which to talk to.

The web UI lets you:
- Ask questions interactively.
- Inspect **traces** of every step.
- Save interactions as **test cases**.

Explore, typing whatever you want and using the buttons to look at what happened. For example, if you ask
it 
```aiexclude
Are you capable of love?
```
it should reply with something like:
```aiexclude
As an AI, I am not capable of experiencing emotions like love. 
Love is a complex human emotion that involves consciousness, personal experiences, feelings, and biological processes 
that are unique to living beings.

My purpose is to process information, understand, and generate human-like text to assist you with questions and tasks. 
While I can access and process a vast amount of information about what love is, how humans experience it, and its 
various expressions, I don't have the capacity to feel or understand it in the way a human does. 
I don't have a body, consciousness, or the biological makeup to experience emotions.
```
I won't comment on this response, other than to say that there are many good reasons why a consumer-facing
chatbot should take this approach.

# XXXXXXXXXXXX

At this point, save your work. I use `git` to do this,


## 1.4 First Evaluation

1. In the web UI, ask: *“What is peer review?”*  
2. Save as a test case.  
3. Run:

```bash
adk eval tests/
```

This ensures the agent still works as expected after changes.

---

## 1.5 What We Learned

- You can build a working research assistant **without writing Python code**.
- `adk run`, `adk web`, and `adk eval` are central tools — use them from the start.
- Evaluation is not an afterthought: you can save and replay tests early.

---

## Demo Exercise

1. Run the agent with `adk web`.  
2. Ask: *“List three key papers on transformers in NLP.”*  
3. Watch how the agent:
   - Calls `google_search`.
   - Summarizes results.
4. Save this as a test case.  

*(Optional)* Swap the model to `anthropic:claude-3-haiku` or `gemini-1.5-flash` and compare outputs.

### Next Chapter Preview
We’ll build a minimal **Python agent** from scratch, add a tool, and compare against this config-only agent.
